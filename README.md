This project was the final assigned in the NEWM-N 315 course, Advanced web development. We were to recreate the Keurig website, specifially the coffee machine page and the checkout page. To be able to add items in the cart, users have to either login or create an account, where authorization is handled by Google Firebase. After a user is successfully signed in, they are freely able to add items to their cart and the icon for the cart page would reflect the amount of items they have stored in their cart. The checkout page itself will display the coffee machines chosen, the total number of items selected, as well as the subtotal and the total with tax. This website is also fully responsive to different screen sizes
